# TODO

## Design

- Carefully think through names of all public methods & see if they could be clearer or more intuitive

## Chores

- Test generators
- Configurable proc for logging method

## Documentation

- Example of checking clean/dirty attributes in instance-level checks. For example, if I'm only allowed to update blue laser cannons, can I make them red? Maybe I need to check whether the old value was blue?
